# Home-Credit-Default-Risk

**Data**  

Data we used in this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk

**Description**  

The project that we are going to do is about credit default risk. We want to build a model that can allows us to forecast the loan default for some applicants. Cleaning data, aggregating variables and feature engineering, and merging datasets are 3 steps of data preparation in my scope. We split the final dataset into train, validation, and test datasets for reducing overfitting and better modelling. Statistical/Machine Learning models which I am going to use are Logistic Regression and Deep Neural Network with cross validation to tune parameters. For handling the imbalance dataset, I am going to use oversampling to let the numbers of data points of class 1 equal to class 0, a.k.a. sample from class 1 by replacement.
